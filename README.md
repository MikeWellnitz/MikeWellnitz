ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Mike Wellnitz. I recently completed the 6 month Data Analytics and Visualization Bootcamp through the University of Minnesota/edX. We learned A LOT in those 6 months, and the projects here highlight the skills I obtained and practiced over the course of the program and after. These projects showcase my progression with coding using SQL and Python. Constant and continued learning will lead me to even more amazing things and allow me to practice the many, many technologies introduced to me.  

Thanks for showing an interest in my journey so far. Please feel free to contact me with any questions!
