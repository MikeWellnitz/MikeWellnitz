ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Mike Wellnitz. I recently completed the 6 month Data Analytics and Visualization Bootcamp through the University of Minnesota/edX. This GitHub showcases some of my favorite assignments from the bootcamp during my learning progression. These are just the beginning! Constant and continued learning will lead me to even more amazing things and allow me to practice the many, many technologies introduced to us these past 6 months. 

Thanks for showing an interest in the highlights thus far of my journey. Please feel free to contact me with any questions!
